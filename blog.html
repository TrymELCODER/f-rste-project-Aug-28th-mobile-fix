<h1>SkinWalker</h1>
<h2>In the Navajo culture, a skinwalker is a type of harmful witch who has the ability to turn into, possess, or disguise themselves as an animal.</h2>
<h2>Sometimes, these witches evolved from living as respected healers or spiritual guides who later chose to use their powers for evil. Though they can be either male or female, they are more often male. They walk freely among the tribe during the day and secretly transform under the cover of the night.

    To become a Skinwalker, he or she must be initiated by a secret society that requires the evilest of deeds â€“ the killing of a close family member, most often a sibling. After completing this task, the individual acquires supernatural powers, which give them the ability to shape-shift into animals. They are often seen as coyotes, wolves, foxes, cougars, dogs, and bears, but they can take the shape of any animal.</h2>
